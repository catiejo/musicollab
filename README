This code was written to accompany the MusiCollab music-making picture frame. The code runs on an Arduino Mega 2560 with a MIDI shield using the CapSense library. For more information on this project, visit www.coroflot.com/catiejo/MusiCollab/.

Directions:
* Load code onto board using Arduino IDE
* Press buttons
* Be amazed (if you just really like sound and flashing lights)
