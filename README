My board consists of a blue and a red LED hooked up to a Pololu A-Star 32u4
Robotic controller. The blue LED blinks at a constant rate of .5Hz, while the
red LED blinks at varying frequencies (cycled by pressing button C). It defaults
to 4Hz.

Directions:
* Load code onto board, then press RESET once
* Press button A to interrupt the blue LED with the red LED
* Press button C to change the blink frequency of the red LED
